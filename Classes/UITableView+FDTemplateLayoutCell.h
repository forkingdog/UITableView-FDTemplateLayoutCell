/// the cell was set up to be self-satisfied, i.e. its content always determines
/// its height given the width is equal to the tableview's.
///
/// @param identifier A string identifier for retrieving and maintaining template
///        cells with system's "-dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:" call.
/// @param configuration An optional block for configuring and providing content
///        to the template cell. The configuration should be minimal for scrolling
///        performance yet sufficient for calculating cell's height.

/// No need to worry about invalidating cached heights when data source changes, it
/// will be done automatically when you call "-reloadData" or any method that triggers
/// UITableView's reloading.
