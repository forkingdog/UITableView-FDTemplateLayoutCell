/// the cell was set up to be self-satisfied, i.e. its content always determines
/// its height given the width is equal to the tableview's.
///
/// @param identifier A string identifier for retrieving and maintaining template
///        cells with system's "-dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:" call.
/// @param configuration An optional block for configuring and providing content
///        to the template cell. The configuration should be minimal for scrolling
///        performance yet sufficient for calculating cell's height.

/// calculated height will be cached by its index path, returns a cached height
/// when needed. Therefore lots of extra height calculations could be saved.

/// No need to worry about invalidating cached heights when data source changes, it
/// will be done automatically when you call "-reloadData" or any method that triggers
/// UITableView's reloading.

///   If no layout constraints have been added to cell's content view, it will automatically
///   switch to "frame layout" mode. Use this property only when you want to manually control
