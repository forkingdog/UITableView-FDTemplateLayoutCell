@interface UITableView (FDTemplateLayoutCell)

/// Returns height of cell of type specifed by a reuse identifier and configured
/// by the configuration block.
///
/// The cell would be layed out on a fixed-width, vertically expanding basis with
/// respect to its dynamic content, using auto layout. Thus, it is imperative that
/// the cell was set up to be self-satisfied, i.e. its content always determines
/// its height given the width is equal to the tableview's.
///
/// @param identifier A string identifier for retrieving and maintaining template
///        cells with system's `dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:` call.
/// @param configuration An optional block for configuring and providing content
///        to the template cell. The configuration should be minimal for scrolling
///        performance yet sufficient for calculating cell's height.
